MPEG player library

This library have NO WARRANTY.  You can use this under Library GPL.
This library uses part from vplay, maplay 1.2 for linux, maplay 1.2+ for Win95.

This is a library which can make programs play MPEG-1/2 audio files easily.

CAUTION
  The current implementation was tested with little endian architecture.
  Bigendian is implemented, but not tested.
  Hackers... please help me!

  What's the difference?  
  For example;
   unsigned char a[4]={0x11,0x22,0x33,0x44};
   unsigned int *b=(unsigned int *)&a;

	Little endian (Intel) : 0x44332211
	Big    endian         : 0x11223344

   The classes 'mpegtoraw' and 'bitwindow' are endian dependent.

  OTHER ENDIAN PROBLEM
    Some machines can access integer type variables when they are aligned
  at 4-bytes. If endian problem is solved. It cause serious problem.

  I have exploited the linear properties of 2 and 3 dimensional arrays.
  like for example;

    int a[4][4];

    a[1][0]==a[0][4] is true.

  Of course, It may occur boundary problem. But it may make player faster!

PROBLEM?
  Please send me bug report or patches.(Please comment where is changed)
